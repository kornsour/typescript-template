# Documentation

Project documentation for this template and the apps built from it.

## Contents

- [`setup/`](./setup) — step-by-step guides to get an app running and
  provisioned: [getting started](./setup/getting-started.md),
  [database](./setup/database.md), [auth](./setup/auth-setup.md),
  [Stripe](./setup/stripe.md), [deployment](./setup/deployment.md).
- [`cli-reference.md`](./cli-reference.md) — the CLIs used to operate the app
  (vercel, neonctl, gcloud, gh, stripe, cf) and the commands agents actually need.
- [`security.md`](./security.md) — the security posture and pre-deploy checklist.
- [`legal.md`](./legal.md) — the legal-disclosure pages (ToS, Privacy, AI
  Disclosure, etc.), what's scaffolded vs. what still needs an attorney, and a
  pre-launch checklist
- [`adr/`](./adr) — Architecture Decision Records: the _why_ behind the stack
  and conventions. Read these before changing foundational tooling.
- [`maintenance/`](./maintenance) — operational runbooks for keeping the
  template healthy (dependency updates, lockfile recovery, etc.).

## Conventions

- Decisions that shape the architecture or are costly to reverse get an ADR.
- Each ADR is immutable once `Accepted`; to change a decision, add a new ADR
  that supersedes the old one (and mark the old one `Superseded by ADR-XXXX`).
- Operational how-tos that aren't decisions go in `maintenance/`.
