# Architecture Decision Records

An ADR captures a single architectural decision: its context, the choice made,
and the consequences. They give future maintainers (human or AI) the _why_, so
decisions aren't silently undone.

## Format

Each record uses a short [MADR](https://adr.github.io/madr/)-style template:

```
# ADR-NNNN: Title

- Status: Proposed | Accepted | Superseded by ADR-XXXX
- Date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Context
## Decision
## Consequences
```

## Process

1. Copy the format above into `NNNN-short-title.md` (next number).
2. Open it as `Proposed` in a PR; mark `Accepted` when merged.
3. Never edit an `Accepted` ADR's decision — supersede it with a new ADR.
