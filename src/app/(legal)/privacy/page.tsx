			<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
			<p>
				Version {LEGAL_VERSION} · Effective {c.effectiveDate} · Last updated {c.lastUpdated}
			</p>

			<h2>1. Who we are</h2>
			<p>
				{c.companyName}, {c.companyEntityType} ("we", "us"), located at {c.registeredAddress},
				operates this website and application (the "Service"). This policy explains what personal
				information we collect, why, and the choices and rights you have.
			</p>

			<h2>2. Information we collect</h2>
			<p>
				<strong>Account data:</strong> name, email address, and password (stored as a salted hash,
				never in plain text) — or, if you sign in with Google/Apple, the profile information those
				providers share with us.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Billing data:</strong> if you subscribe to a paid plan, our payment processor Stripe
				collects and stores your payment method; we receive your subscription status and Stripe
				customer ID, not your full card number.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Content you provide:</strong> anything you submit through the Service, including
				input to any AI feature (see <Link href="/ai-disclosure">AI Disclosure</Link>).
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Technical data:</strong> IP address, browser/device information, session tokens, and
				log data, collected automatically to operate and secure the Service.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Cookies:</strong> see our <Link href="/cookies">Cookie Policy</Link>.
			</p>

			<h2>3. How we use information</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					To provide, maintain, and secure the Service (e.g. authentication, fraud prevention).
				</li>
				<li>To process payments and manage subscriptions.</li>
				<li>To send account, security, and (where applicable) billing emails.</li>
				<li>
					To operate any AI feature you use, including sending your input to the AI provider(s)
					named in the AI Disclosure.
				</li>
				<li>
					To comply with legal obligations and enforce our <Link href="/terms">Terms</Link> and{" "}
					<Link href="/acceptable-use">Acceptable Use Policy</Link>.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				We do not currently use analytics, advertising, or marketing trackers that rely on
				non-essential cookies. If that changes, we will update this policy and our{" "}
				<Link href="/cookies">Cookie Policy</Link> before those tools are enabled.
			</p>

			<h2>4. Legal basis (EU/UK visitors)</h2>
			<p>
				If you're in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, the GDPR/UK GDPR requires a lawful basis for each
				use above: performance of a contract (providing the Service you signed up for), legitimate
				interests (security, fraud prevention, product improvement), consent (where we ask for it,
				e.g. optional cookies), and legal obligation (tax, compliance). You can withdraw
				consent-based processing at any time without affecting past processing.
			</p>

			<h2>5. Who we share information with</h2>
			<p>We don't sell your personal information. We share it only with:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Service providers who process data on our behalf (e.g. hosting/infrastructure, Stripe for
					billing, our email provider for transactional email).
				</li>
				<li>
					AI providers, when you use an AI feature — currently: {c.aiSubprocessors.join(", ")} (see{" "}
					<Link href="/ai-disclosure">AI Disclosure</Link> for what's sent and why).
				</li>
				<li>
					Law enforcement or other parties when required by law, or to protect the rights, safety,
					or property of us or others.
				</li>
				<li>
					A successor entity in the event of a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, with notice to
					you.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>6. Data retention</h2>
			<p>
				We retain account data for as long as your account is active, and for a reasonable period
				afterward to comply with legal, tax, and security obligations. You can request deletion at
				any time (Section 8); some data may be retained where law requires it (e.g. billing
				records).
			</p>

			<h2>7. International transfers</h2>
			<p>
				We're based in the United States, and information we collect is processed there and by
				service providers in other countries. Where GDPR applies, we rely on appropriate safeguards
				for transfers out of the EEA/UK (e.g. Standard Contractual Clauses) with our providers.
			</p>

			<h2>8. Your rights</h2>
			<p>
				<strong>California residents (CCPA/CPRA):</strong> you have the right to know what personal
				information we collect and how we use/disclose it, to request deletion, to correct
				inaccurate information, and to opt out of the sale or sharing of personal information — we
				don't sell or share personal information as those terms are defined by the CCPA/CPRA. You
				won't be discriminated against for exercising these rights.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Other U.S. states</strong> (e.g. Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, and others
				with comprehensive privacy laws) provide similar rights to access, correct, delete, and
				obtain a copy of your data, and to opt out of targeted advertising, sale, or certain
				profiling — to the extent those laws apply to us.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>EEA/UK/Switzerland residents (GDPR/UK GDPR):</strong> you have the right to access,
				correct, delete, restrict or object to processing, and receive a portable copy of your data,
				and to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority.
			</p>
			<p>
				To exercise any of these rights, email {c.privacyEmail}. We may need to verify your identity
				before fulfilling a request.
			</p>
			<p>
				Where applicable law requires additional notices, representation, or consent controls for
				EU/UK visitors, we will provide and maintain those controls in product and in our{" "}
				<Link href="/cookies">Cookie Policy</Link>.
			</p>

			<h2>9. Children's privacy</h2>
			<p>
				The Service isn't directed to children under 13 (or under 16 where required by applicable
				law), and we don't knowingly collect personal information from them. If you believe a child
				has provided us personal information, contact {c.privacyEmail} and we'll delete it.
			</p>

			<h2>10. Security</h2>
			<p>
				We use technical and organizational measures appropriate to the sensitivity of the data we
				hold (encryption in transit, hashed passwords, access controls) — see{" "}
				<code>docs/security.md</code> in this project for the current baseline. No method of
				transmission or storage is 100% secure.
			</p>

			<h2>11. Changes to this policy</h2>
			<p>
				We may update this policy from time to time. Material changes will update the "Version" and
				"Last updated" date above, and where required by law we'll provide additional notice.
			</p>

			<h2>12. Contact</h2>
			<p>
				Questions or rights requests: {c.privacyEmail} — {c.registeredAddress}.
