			<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
			<p>
				Version {LEGAL_VERSION} · Effective {c.effectiveDate} · Last updated {c.lastUpdated}
			</p>

			<h2>1. Acceptance of terms</h2>
			<p>
				These Terms of Service ("Terms") are a binding agreement between you and {c.companyName},{" "}
				{c.companyEntityType} ("{c.companyName}", "we", "us"). By creating an account or otherwise
				using our website, application, or related services (the "Service"), you agree to these
				Terms and to our <Link href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</Link> and{" "}
				<Link href="/acceptable-use">Acceptable Use Policy</Link>, which are incorporated by
				reference. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.
			</p>

			<h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
			<p>
				You must be at least 18 years old, or the age of legal majority in your jurisdiction, to
				create an account. The Service is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly
				collect personal information from them (see <Link href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</Link>). If
				you use the Service on behalf of a company or other entity, you represent that you have
				authority to bind that entity to these Terms.
			</p>

			<h2>3. The Service</h2>
			<p>
				The Service may include features that use artificial intelligence, including generative AI,
				to produce content or recommendations. Section 7 and our{" "}
				<Link href="/ai-disclosure">AI Disclosure</Link> govern your use of those features and take
				precedence over this section for anything AI-related. We may add, change, or remove features
				at any time.
			</p>

			<h2>4. Accounts</h2>
			<p>
				You're responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials and for all
				activity under your account. Notify us immediately of any unauthorized use. We may suspend
				or terminate accounts that violate these Terms or the{" "}
				<Link href="/acceptable-use">Acceptable Use Policy</Link>.
			</p>

			<h2>5. Subscriptions &amp; billing</h2>
			<p>
				Paid plans are billed in advance on a recurring basis (monthly or annual, as selected)
				through our payment processor, Stripe. By subscribing, you authorize recurring charges to
				your payment method until you cancel. Fees are non-refundable except where required by law
				or stated otherwise at purchase. You can cancel at any time; cancellation takes effect at
				the end of the current billing period unless we state otherwise. We may change pricing with
				advance notice; continued use after a price change takes effect constitutes acceptance.
			</p>

			<h2>6. Acceptable use</h2>
			<p>
				You agree to use the Service only as permitted by these Terms, applicable law, and our{" "}
				<Link href="/acceptable-use">Acceptable Use Policy</Link>, which describes prohibited
				conduct in detail (including misuse of any AI features). We may remove content or suspend
				access for violations.
			</p>

			<h2>7. AI features &amp; disclaimers</h2>
			<p>
				If the Service offers AI-generated content, recommendations, or automated responses, that
				output is produced by machine-learning models and may be incorrect, incomplete, biased, or
				offensive. AI output is provided "as is" and is <strong>not</strong> professional advice
				(legal, medical, financial, or otherwise) unless a specific feature explicitly says so in
				writing. You are responsible for independently verifying any AI output before relying on it.
				Full detail: <Link href="/ai-disclosure">AI Disclosure</Link>.
			</p>

			<h2>8. Your content</h2>
			<p>
				You retain ownership of content you submit to the Service ("User Content"). You grant us a
				worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to host, store, process, and display User
				Content solely to operate and improve the Service, including sending it to the third-party
				AI providers described in the <Link href="/ai-disclosure">AI Disclosure</Link> where an AI
				feature is involved. You represent that you have the rights necessary to grant this license
				and that your User Content doesn't infringe or violate anyone's rights.
			</p>

			<h2>9. Intellectual property</h2>
			<p>
				The Service, including its software, design, and branding (excluding User Content), is owned
				by {c.companyName} or its licensors and protected by intellectual property laws. These Terms
				don't grant you any rights to our trademarks or branding.
			</p>

			<h2>10. Third-party services</h2>
			<p>
				The Service may link to or integrate with third-party services (e.g. Stripe, Google, Apple,
				AI model providers). We aren't responsible for third-party services, and your use of them is
				subject to their own terms and privacy policies.
			</p>

			<h2>11. Disclaimer of warranties</h2>
			<p>
				THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE," WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS
				OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND
				NON-INFRINGEMENT. WE DON'T WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE (INCLUDING ANY AI FEATURE) WILL BE
				UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, OR ACCURATE.
			</p>

			<h2>12. Limitation of liability</h2>
			<p>
				TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, {c.companyName.toUpperCase()} WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR
				ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF
				PROFITS, DATA, OR GOODWILL, ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE. OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR
				ANY CLAIM WILL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF (A) THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US IN THE 12 MONTHS BEFORE
				THE CLAIM AROSE, OR (B) $100.
			</p>

			<h2>13. Indemnification</h2>
			<p>
				You agree to indemnify and hold {c.companyName} harmless from claims, damages, and expenses
				(including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from your use of the Service, your User
				Content, or your violation of these Terms or applicable law.
			</p>

			<h2>14. Term &amp; termination</h2>
			<p>
				These Terms apply from when you first use the Service until terminated. You may stop using
				the Service and delete your account at any time. We may suspend or terminate your access for
				violation of these Terms, non-payment, or as required by law. Sections that by their nature
				should survive termination (e.g. 9, 11–13) will survive.
			</p>

			<h2>15. Governing law &amp; disputes</h2>
			<p>
				These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of {c.governingLawState}, without regard
				to conflict-of-laws rules. Any dispute not otherwise resolved will be brought exclusively in
				the state or federal courts located in {c.governingLawVenue}, and you consent to that
				jurisdiction and venue.
			</p>

			<h2>16. Changes to these Terms</h2>
			<p>
				We may update these Terms from time to time. Material changes will update the "Version" and
				"Last updated" date above; where required by law, or where you've already registered an
				account, we'll provide additional notice (e.g. email or in-app) and may require you to
				re-accept before continuing to use the Service.
			</p>

			<h2>17. Contact</h2>

				Questions about these Terms: {c.contactEmail} — {c.registeredAddress}.
