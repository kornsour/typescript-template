			<h2>1. What we use today</h2>
			<p>
				As shipped, this template only sets <strong>strictly necessary</strong> cookies: a signed
				session cookie (set by better-auth) used to keep you signed in, and — if you use Google or
				Apple sign-in — a short-lived state cookie used to complete that OAuth flow. Under
				GDPR/ePrivacy and similar laws, strictly necessary cookies don't require consent, only clear
				disclosure — which is what this page and the cookie notice banner provide.
			</p>

			<h2>2. If you add analytics, ads, or other tracking</h2>
			<p>
				<em>
					[TODO: this template does not ship analytics, advertising, or other non-essential
					cookies/trackers. If you add one (e.g. product analytics, ad pixels, session replay), you
					must: list it here with its purpose and duration, and — for EU/UK visitors and
					California's opt-out-of-sale/sharing rules — upgrade{" "}
					<code>src/components/cookie-banner.tsx</code> from a notice into a real accept/reject
					consent control before it loads. Don't fire non-essential trackers before consent.]
				</em>
			</p>

			<h2>3. Managing cookies</h2>
			<p>
				Most browsers let you block or delete cookies in their settings. Blocking the session cookie
				will sign you out and may prevent you from using features that require an account.
