# CI guard: fails if pnpm-lock.yaml contains duplicate mapping keys — the
# recurring Dependabot corruption documented in docs/maintenance/pnpm-lockfile.md.
# CI on pnpm 10 tolerates duplicate YAML keys, so `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`
# passes while Dependabot's stricter parser (and pnpm 11) reject the file and
# turn main red. This check closes that gap so it can gate every PR — especially
# auto-merged Dependabot ones, where no human is watching.
#
# Usage: check-lockfile.sh [path-to-lockfile]   (defaults to pnpm-lock.yaml)

# inside packages:/snapshots:, which is exactly where the corruption lands.
